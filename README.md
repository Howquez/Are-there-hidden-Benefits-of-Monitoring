I originally pre-specified an analysis corresponding to my Master Thesis [read PDF](https://github.com/Howquez/Are-there-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/Thesis.pdf) on Github. Due to restrictions, I set the repo private.

This is why you will not find any real data in here. Instead, I plan to simulate some data and showcase the eventual master thesis, together with the analysis of the simulated data in [this Gitbook](https://howquez.github.io/Are-there-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/).

Besides that, I'll have to format citations etc. You can consider the project therefore as WIP.
