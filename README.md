# üëÄ Are there (hidden) benefits of monnitoring?
As a part of my master's thesis I conducted an economic lab experiment together with Alexander Sebald and Georg Kirchsteiger. With the help of intention based reciprocity theories, we predict productive employees to be even more productive under managerial attention while they decrease their output in the absence of it. The opposite holds true to unproductive employees.

The rationale behind that is the following: Paying attention to productive employees helps them to attribute their output to their input. As a consequence, monitoring improves their chances of receiving a bonus and is interpreted as kind -- especially when monitoring is costly (due to technology or opportunity costs). Reciprocal employees pass back the kindness by producing more. Not beeing observed is interpreted as unkind and this unkindness is passed back by shirking.

## ‚úÖ What you can find in this repository
I uploaded the thesis [as a PDF](https://github.com/Howquez/Are-there-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/blob/master/Thesis.pdf) and prepared a [this Gitbook](https://howquez.github.io/Are-there-hidden-Benefits-of-Monitoring/) which does not contain real data due to data availability restrictions.

## ‚ùå What you can not find in this repository
I originally pre-specified an analysis corresponding to the thesis on Github. Due to the mentioned restrictions, I set the repo private. The Gitbook therefore requires some preparation and enrichments (artificial data).
